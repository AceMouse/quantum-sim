\section{Further work \& Acknowledgements}
I unfortunately did not have time to look into nor implement the zip-up algorithm discussed in the paper which could be something interesting to work on.  
I would like to acknowledge Michael Kastoryano and Nutan Limaye for their supervision, I would not have been even a third of the way by now without them. I would also like to acknowledge Sebastian Loeschcke for giving a few tips and tricks for working with the python library quimb, which saved me many hours.
